v0.1c

	MP is displayed
	magic uses MP
	items have a limited number, get used up
	enemy uses magic (chosen at random)& MP

	:: At this point, start to think about incorporating more characters, each with own stats, HP & MP.
		Also multiple enemies chosen at random at the start of battle.
		Big factor here is how to incorporate the speed stat of each mob.

General Ideas:

A lot of inspiration from FF10 and a bit from marvel universe!

characters don't have a "level", just train to increase stats. Still use XP system, FF10 style. - NEED CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT PLAN.

7 elements (fire, electric, ice, water, metal, light, dark) - strengths and weaknesses need balancing.
7 character, one subtly associated with each element
I like the number 7.
stats go up to 100 each, but elemental stones are found optionally (one per element)
elemental stones are rarity not mentioned in canon story, allow stats for designated character to reach 255 and break damage limit (9,999) to reach new damage limit (99,999).
